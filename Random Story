Once upon a time there was a shoe
It was a left shoe
The shoe was alone
where you ask?
Not important 
But it was found by a young girl
The girl loved that shoe 
And gave herself the goal to find the other shoe
years pass
only two though
because two allows plurality
So now she's twelve
And she sees a boy
What's his name you ask?
Not important 
Stop asking stupid questions
Anyways
She asks him where he found that shoe
And he told her that's not important
what is important...
Is how beautiful she was 
how beautiful he thought she was
He then proposed
Then she replied, "I'm twelve"
So they dated instead
into high school
And finally Prom comes up
they're still dating
They go to prom together 
she wears the shoes to prom
She then asks the boy...
"Can you get me some punch?"
And the boy replies...
...
...
There is no punch line
